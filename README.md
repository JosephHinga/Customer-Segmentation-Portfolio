# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means

📌 Project Overview

This project applies K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their income and spending behavior. By identifying meaningful customer groups, the project provides insights businesses can use to improve targeting, marketing efficiency, and overall customer engagement.

The notebook used for this analysis:
Customer_Segmentation_.ipynb

🎯 Project Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis to understand customer behavior.

Use clustering techniques to identify distinct customer groups.

Visualize customer segments for better interpretability.

Generate actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

🧠 Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-Learn (KMeans)

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Process Summary
1. Data Loading & Cleaning

Imported the dataset

Handled missing values (if any)

Selected key features for clustering:

Income

Spending Score

2. Feature Preparation

Scaled/processed the data

Prepared the dataset for K-Means clustering

3. Model Training

Applied K-Means with an appropriate number of clusters

Assigned each customer to a specific segment

4. Visualization

Plotted income vs. spending score

Colored clusters for easy interpretation

🧩 Key Findings (Cluster Insights)
⭐ Cluster 1 — Primary Target Segment

High-income customers with high spending scores

Represents the most valuable customer group

60% of this cluster are women, making them ideal for targeted premium marketing

Recommended Action:
Focus campaigns on popular items tailored to this demographic

⭐ Cluster 2 — Growth Opportunity

Moderate-income customers responsive to discounts and promotional events

Recommended Action:
Prioritize sales-driven marketing for higher conversions

⭐ Cluster 3 — Low-Value Segment

Low-income and low spending score

Recommended Action:
Minimal marketing spend; focus on retention strategies

🚀 Results & Impact

This project demonstrates the ability to:

Transform raw data into strategic insights

Apply machine learning algorithms for business use cases

Communicate findings clearly through visuals and narrative

Provide data-driven recommendations that support decision-making

This work showcases my skills in EDA, machine learning, data visualization, and business-oriented analysis, making it a valuable addition to my data portfolio.
